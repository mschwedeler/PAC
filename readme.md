This repository contains Python code that transforms bulk PAC data from the [Center for Responsive politics](https://www.opensecrets.org) into firm-quarter level data ready to be used in further analyses. In the last step I use a Stata do file for convenience, but this could of course be done in Python too.

To run this code, you will need to first obtain the following input files:
 - the `company` and `g_company` file from WRDS
 - the `CampaignFinXX.zip` files from the CRP.
I provided a bit more information about these input files in the readme files of the respective input folders.

Use at your own responsibility.
